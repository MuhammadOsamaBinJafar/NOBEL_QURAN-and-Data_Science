They said: \"O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel\u00c2\u00b4s load (of grain to our provisions).

He said (to him): \"Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings.\"","1630":"At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them he put the drinking cup into his brother\u00c2\u00b4s saddle-bag.

Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one the All-Knowing.","1637":"They said: \"If he steals there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).\" But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): \"Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!\"","1638":"They said: \"O exalted one! Behold! he has a father aged and venerable (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good.\"","1639":"He said: \"Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so) we should be acting wrongfully.","1640":"Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding) they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: \"Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah\u00c2\u00b4s name and how before this ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.","1641":"\"Turn ye back to your father and say \u00c2\u00b4O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know and we could not well guard against the unseen!","1642":"\"\u00c2\u00b4Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.\u00c2\u00b4\"","1643":"Jacob said: \"Nay but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end).

(never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness or until thou die!\"","1646":"He said: \"I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah and I know from Allah that which ye know not...","1647":"\"O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother and never give up hope of Allah\u00c2\u00b4s Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah\u00c2\u00b4s Soothing Mercy except those who have no faith.\"","1648":"Then when they came (back) into (Joseph\u00c2\u00b4s) presence they said: \"O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty capital: so pay us full measure (we pray thee) and treat it as charity to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable.\"","1649":"He said: \"Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother not knowing (what ye were doing)?\"","1650":"They said: \"Art thou indeed Joseph?\" He said \"I am Joseph and this is my brother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us (all): behold he that is righteous and patient#NAME? of those who do right.\"","1651":"They said: \"By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us and we certainly have been guilty of sin!\"","1652":"He said: \"This day let no reproach be (cast) on you: Allah will forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!","1653":"\"Go with this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see (clearly). Then come ye (here) to me together with all your family.\"","1654":"When the caravan left (Egypt) their father said: \"I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph: Nay think me not a dotard.\"","1655":"They said: \"By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind.\"","1656":"Then when the bearer of the good news came He cast (the shirt) over his face and he forthwith regained clear sight.
